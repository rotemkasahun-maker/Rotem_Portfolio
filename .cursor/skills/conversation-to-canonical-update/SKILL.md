# Conversation to Canonical Update

## Detect durable decisions
Examples:
- architecture choice
- source-of-truth change
- locked visual direction
- approved product behavior
- changed data invariant
- DO NOT TOUCH boundary
- resolved blocker
- canonical naming/taxonomy
- deployment/branch workflow change

Ignore brainstorming not selected, temporary troubleshooting, and speculative ideas.

## Route
- code/architecture → repository documentation
- design DNA/locked UI → Figma notes or canonical design-state doc
- financial taxonomy/data rules → canonical data/config docs
- operational document → Drive/project doc
- recurring future action → automation

## Before writing
DECISION:
CANONICAL DESTINATION:
EXISTING SECTION TO UPDATE:
OLD STATE:
NEW STATE:
WHY DURABLE:
REGRESSION/DEPENDENCY NOTES:

Avoid duplicating the same decision across many files.
